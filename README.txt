Python and pygame: Bouncy ball (gravity and vectors)
===============================================



Simple project that simulates simple (not all) laws of physics such as gravity, vectors, forces etc...

This project uses pygame for drawing shapes. Some concepts of physics and maths are also applied with the help of some pygame modules.

The main idea of this project is, as I said before, to simulate gravity and collision detection. I achieved this by using basic math and vector calculations, in addition, primitive collision detection was also used in this project.

If you have any questions or suggestions on how to improve this project, please email me: matheusgarcia28@gmail.com .

Thank you!
